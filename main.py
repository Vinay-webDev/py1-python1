# variable = a container for a value. it behaves as the value that it contains

first_name = "bro"
last_name = "dude"
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name)
print (name)
print ("Hello " +name)
print (type(first_name))
print("Hello " + full_name)

age = 23

weight = 56.5
print(weight)
print("your weight is: "+str(weight)+"KG")

print("Are u human: "+str(human))

multiple assignment = it allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code

name = "dude"
age = 23
human = True
print(name)
print(age)
print(human)

name,age,human ="dude",23,True
print(name)
print(age)
print(human)


lol = 100
nigga = 100
gey = 100
retard = 100

lol=nigga=gey=retard = 100
print(lol)
print(nigga)
print(gey)
print(retard)

print(name.find("d"))
print(name.capitalize())
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
print(name.isdigit())
